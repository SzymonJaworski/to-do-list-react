# To-Do List — React Version

My task list application refactored into **React** as a major milestone in my frontend development journey. This project focuses on component-based architecture, state management, and a declarative approach to building user interfaces.


## Key Features
* **State Management**: Using **Redux Toolkit** for predictable state updates across the app.
* **Asynchronous Logic**: Side effects like fetching example tasks handled by **Redux-Saga**.
* **Dynamic Routing**: Multi-page experience with **React Router**, including dedicated task detail views.
* **Styled Components**: Modern styling with CSS-in-JS, featuring a centered, responsive layout.
* **LocalStorage**: Tasks are persisted in the browser, so you never lose your data.
* **Search & Filter**: Real-time task filtering using URL query parameters.


## Technologies
* **React** (Hooks, Router)
* **Redux (Toolkit & Saga)**
* **Styled Components**
* **JavaScript** (ES6+)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
